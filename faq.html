                    <p>
                        Basically, the IPL light is attracted to the pigment in the hair. The point of IPL is to shrink the hair follicle in which the hair sits, so that the hair can’t grow any longer. The real plus is it is Pain Free.
                        
                        IPL is non monochromatic (not a single wavelength) and non-focused, treats multiple follicles at once, and is attracted to varying degrees of hair colour.
                        
                        IPL covers a larger area per pulse of light therefore making the process faster and with the added benefit of seeing many shades of colour.

                <button class="accordion">Is IPL Hair Removal Safe?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        Treatments are perfectly safe when performed with quality equipment and by experienced therapists who also hold Laser Safety certificates. IPL (the type of treatment we use at Hairfree + Beauty) uses only pulsed light during the session. There is no radiation, no UV rays or nasty chemicals involved.
                        
                        You should avoid shady hair removal operators that use cheap machines or poorly-trained staff. It’s not worth the risk.

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Hairfree IPL machines selectively target hair follicles and therefore cause no damage to the surrounding skin. Some people experience slight, localised redness immediately after the treatment which quickly dissipates.</p>
